Ebooks.coop is all about removing the barriers between authors and consumers of
digital media.  Today, publishers, Apple, and Amazon take the lion's share,
leaving authors typically only 15% of each ebook sale, while musicians typical
receive only 1% of each song sold.  There are huge savings to be had by simply
removing the middle-men. That's what Ebooks.coop is all about.

As a member owned cooperative, Ebooks.coop aims to save it's members money.  Our
prices will typically reflect the prices seen on other sites, as price-fixing is
nearly standard throughout the industry.  However, as an owner, members of
Ebooks.coop will earn a share in the profits in proportion to how much they
spend.

We'll have more than ebooks, too.  Members will be able to purchase just about
any sort of digital media that can be legally downloaded through the Internet.
We'll also have many free selections, from Gutenberg.org and Librivox.org.  In
addition, we believe in accessibility, and will support Bookshare.org for people
with vision impairments, and enable text-to-speech on all titles.

For now, we are in the process of incorporation.  If you want to take part in
helping us form Ebooks.coop, please register on this site.  We'll e-mail you
when we have more details.
