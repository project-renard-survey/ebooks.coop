Ebooks.coop is all about removing the barriers between artists and consumers of
digital media.  Today, publishers, Apple, and Amazon take the lion's share,
leaving musicians with a typical 1% of each song sold, and authors 15% of each
book.  There are huge savings to be had by simply removing the middle-men.
That's what Ebooks.coop is all about.
