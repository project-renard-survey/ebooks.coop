<h1>About ShareALot.org</h1>

<p>ShareALot.org's mission is to enable the unemployed to use their valuable
skills and time working to help each other.  It creates a marketplace for free
services that people can provide for each other while waiting for the economy
to turn around.  If you have valuable skills but not enough work to make full
use of them, consider donating your time to others in the same predicament.</p>

<p>ShareALot.org let's you offer your services in trade for "stars".  So, for
example, you might have your house cleaned for around 80 stars.  To buy that
service, you need stars to spend.  You earn stars by offering services to
others.</p>

<p>Membership is free.  There are no dues, or fees of any kind.
ShareALot.org is currently an informal self-help group.</p>

<h1>Trading Stars</h1>

<p>America's free market economy works great most of the time.  However, in
today's severe recession, many good poeple are out of work, and out of money.
Without money, we can't pay each other to do the things we normally would.
Instead of helping each other, our skills are wasted.  At ShareALot.org, we
want to enable people who are out of work and short on cash to get back to
working for each other.  Our solution for rewarding each other when no one has
cash is to use 'stars'.  You should think of stars as Monopoly money.  You
can't buy food with it, or pay your rent.  However, with a healthy sense of
charity, you might be able to help someone, and someone might help you.</p>

<p>You should offer your services at roughly what it would cost in dollars.
So, for example, if you charge $50/hour for your service normally, consider
charging 50 stars/hour for the same.  If you wind up giving a bit more than you
get, remember that you are aiding the shared goal of getting us all through
this economic downturn.  The only restriction is that you must charge at least
10 stars/hour for your time (our minimum wage) and no more than 200 stars/hour
(our maximum wage).  You can also ask for dollars to cover out-of-pocket
expenses.  For example, a painter could ask for 50 stars/hour plus money for
paint.</p>

<p>Buying and selling stars is not allowed, and you may not barter
stars for physical items.  As a purely fictional quantity, it makes
little sense to hoard them.  You are encouraged to spend what you
earn, and keep your balance near the average of 1000 stars.</p>

<!--
<h1>Community Service</h1>

<p>Your account at ShareALot.org starts at 0 stars.  You may offer
services right away, but you must earn stars before you can request
any services.  Participating charities should be able to give you a
minimum of 10 stars/hour for your time, so there will be ways to earn
stars.</p>

<h1>Initial Charitable Donation</h1>

<p>When you sign up, you must choose one or more charities to
sponsor.  After you account becomes active (by earning a certain
number of stars), 1000 stars will be donated to your sponsored
charities, split evenly.</p>

<h1>Star Values</h1>

<p>ShareALot.org uses a system invented by children:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The basic unit is the star
<img style="margin-top:6px" border="0" src="images/star.png" width="45" height="45" alt="star" title="star">
	<li>10 stars = 1 moon
<img style="margin-top:6px" border="0" src="images/moon.png" width="45" height="45" alt="moon" title="moon">
	<li>10 moons = 1 butterfly
<img style="margin-top:6px" border="0" src="images/butterfly.gif" width="45" height="45" alt="butterfly" title="butterfly">
	<li>10 butterflies = 1 unicorn
<img style="margin-top:6px" border="0" src="images/unicorn.gif" width="80" height="60" alt="unicorn" title="unicorn">
</ul>
<p>Maintaining proper star flow is a complex problem, and chances are
that ShareALot.org will from time to time need to change it's
policies for creating, or destroying stars.  These policies have one
goal: enabling users to share their skills and time as effortlessly
as possible.  We face several challenges in this task:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Having too few stars on average in
	accounts can make large transactions difficult or impossible</li>
	<li>Having too many stars on average
	in accounts can lead to artificial inflation of service rates</li>
	<li>Changes in star policy need to fairly affect everyone fairly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we describe our initial policy.  We will try to announce any
change in policy well in advance to allow time for feedback on the
new policy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>New users have an initial balance of 0 stars</li>
	<li>To maintain an average of 1000 stars per account, we donate 1000 stars to participating
	charities new account activated.  Charities start out with 1000 stars.</li>
	<li>Users are only activated once a charity pays a user some stars.</li>
</ul>
